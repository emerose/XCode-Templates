# XCode template files

This project contains some simple templates for XCode.  They differ from the
Apple-distributed ones primarily in that:

- they include unit test templates based on [GHUnit](http://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit)
- they use [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)-formatted comments

## Installation

Run `install.sh`.

## TODO

- I haven't been able to figure out how to get classTest.m to `#import`
class.h automatically.
- Add the "Subclass of" dropdown for various useful classes
- Maybe also make the test.m file optional, with a checkbox?

## LICENSE

Do whatever you want with it.  Let me know if you do something cool, though.
